#### Chief Scientist, Kaspect
I've made a mission of revolutionizing the way we garner insight from biomedical data, through the combined creativity of a diverse team, and a structured design process for data science. As the Chief Scientist of Kaspect, a consultancy for artificial intelligence strategy, I guide companies in creating new intellectual property. In each of my projects, I leverage my wealth of experience from working with Fortune 10 companies, hospital networks, national legal firms, and biotechnology companies.

#### Graduate Fellow, National Science Foundation (NSF)
My Ph.D. research is primarily focused on predicting human muscle control patterns in health, development, aging, and pathological conditions, and the design of artificial intelligence pipelines capable of handling new levels of data. This will serve as a neuromechanical template to interpret the torrent of behavioral data now available from patients and athletes. I work with Francisco Valero-Cuevas at USC, on multiple initiatives funded by the US National Institute of Health and USC.



# Contact

Given my roles as a scientist and business owner, I set aside time to evaluate new opportunities.

Below are the ways you can reach me, along with some relevant instructions.

## Licensing of Software or Technique Inquiries
If you or your company is pursuing a software license for one of the technologies I have developed, these requests are handled by the USC Stevens Institute Center for Innovation.

## Opportunities
One of the things I love about science is how big collaborations can be sparked by mere conversation, across universities, companies, and governments. If you have a project you're working on that might interest me, given the topics I publish in, send it to ideas@briancohn.com.

## Interview Requests
Please send requests for radio, print, podcast interviews/consultations to ask@briancohn.com.

## Speaking
I am fully booked for speaking engagments through the end of 2017. For speaking engagements in 2018 onwards, send information to [keynote@briancohn.com](mailto:keynote@brian.cohn.com).
