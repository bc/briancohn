    Wings guide fluid flow, eyes refract light, and muscles produce forces. Organisms derive biological structure to profitably manipulate Newtonian physics.
    Here we apply basic tenets of mechanics to elucidate the  fundamental problem brains face when controlling numerous muscles to produce limb function.
    This novel perspective provides a context to unify three dominant approaches to this fundamental question in neuroscience.
    The tractable example of producing fingertip force serves to illuminate how the anatomy of the body and the mechanical constraints defining a particular task determine the well-structured set of feasible neural commands to produce it.
    This, in turn, is the landscape upon which a neural controller operates to exploit the mechanical wherewithal of its physical body.
