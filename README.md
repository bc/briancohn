#### Chief Scientist, Kaspect <link to kaspect>
I've made a mission of revolutionizing the way we garner insight from biomedical data, through the combined creativity of a diverse team, and a structured design process for data science. As the Chief Scientist of Kaspect, a consultancy for artificial intelligence strategy, I guide companies in creating new intellectual property. In each of my projects, I leverage my wealth of experience from working with Fortune 10 companies, hospital networks, national legal firms, and biotechnology companies.

#### Graduate Fellow, National Science Foundation (NSF) <link to research>
My Ph.D. research is primarily focused on predicting human muscle control patterns in health, development, aging, and pathological conditions, and the design of artificial intelligence pipelines capable of handling new levels of data. This will serve as a neuromechanical template to interpret the torrent of behavioral data now available from patients and athletes. I work with Francisco Valero-Cuevas at USC, on multiple initiatives funded by the US National Institute of Health and USC.

## Peer Reviewed Publications
1. __Feasibility Theory reconciles alternative approaches to neuromuscular control__.  
In Review: Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. September 2017.  
Cohn BA, Jalaleddini K, Valero-Cuevas FJ  


    Wings guide fluid flow, eyes refract light, and muscles produce forces. Organisms derive biological structure to profitably manipulate Newtonian physics.
    Here we apply basic tenets of mechanics to elucidate the  fundamental problem brains face when controlling numerous muscles to produce limb function.
    This novel perspective provides a context to unify three dominant approaches to this fundamental question in neuroscience.
    The tractable example of producing fingertip force serves to illuminate how the anatomy of the body and the mechanical constraints defining a particular task determine the well-structured set of feasible neural commands to produce it.
    This, in turn, is the landscape upon which a neural controller operates to exploit the mechanical wherewithal of its physical body.

# Contact

Given my roles as a scientist and business owner, I set aside time to evaluate new opportunities. 
Below are the ways you can reach me, along with some relevant instructions.

## Licensing of Software or Technique Inquiries
If you or your company is pursuing a software license for one of the technologies I have developed, these requests are handled by the USC Stevens Institute Center for Innovation.

## Opportunities
One of the things I love about science is how quickly an idea can affect an industry, and how they can be sources from universities, companies, and governments. If you have a project you're working on that might interest me, given the topics I publish in, send it to ideas@briancohn.com.

## Interview Requests
Please send requests for radio, print, podcast interviews/consultations to ask@briancohn.com.

## Speaking
I am fully booked for speaking engagments through the end of 2017. For speaking engagements in 2018 onwards, send information to [keynote@briancohn.com](mailto:keynote@brian.cohn.com).
