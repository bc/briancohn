    <h2>CHIEF DATA SCIENTIST, <br>KASPECT</h2>


  <p>  I leverage my experience with Fortune 10 companies, hospital networks, national legal firms, and biotechnology companies to better protect and advance client IP portfolios. Kaspect is a strategy consultancy focusing on the intersection of modern business and artificial intelligence.
</p>
    <h2>GRADUATE FELLOW,<br>
    NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h2>

    <p>My Ph.D. research is focused on predicting human muscle control patterns in health, development, aging, and pathological conditions, and the design of artificial intelligence pipelines capable of handling new levels of data. This will serve as a neuromechanical template to interpret the torrent of behavioral data now available from patients and athletes. I work with Francisco Valero-Cuevas at the University of Southern California, on multiple initiatives funded by the US National Institute of Health.</p>
